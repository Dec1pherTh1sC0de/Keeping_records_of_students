# Keeping records of students

## About the program:
This program is my assignment in practice, it is designed to keep track of students in college. This program is my first program written in C++ and Qt.

## Instruction for the first start:
After compiling this program from the source code, we get an executable file. After launching the executable file, an authorization window will open and an empty database will be created. Next, close the authorization window, replace the database created by the program with the database from the source folder. The name of the database is "`my_db.sqlite`" in the source folder. Next, run the executable file again and enter the program. 

### Authorization data for the administrator:

### Authorization data for the user:
